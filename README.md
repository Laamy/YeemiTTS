trying to get this to work on other audio cables so i can use it in discord (im white btw)

# get working?
its meant to be a tool to replace balabolka for myself and mysekf only but if you want to get it workign its pretty simple, in program.cs replace the virtual cable string with your own driver you want to play the TTS through or remkove the index stuff compeltely and do -1 for default device

its only that driver cuz i like to split my main desktop sounds with other things like TTS
